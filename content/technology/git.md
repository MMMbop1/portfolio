Before git developers had to save versions of their work manually in their folders. However this was a very tedious work. So a finnish guy came up with an idea, why not create an application that will make this tedious work for us? Well, git was born, now users can commit their work locally and then push it and the work will merge with the "main root" it allows multiply developers work on the same root but at different branches at the same time!
